Cab Booking Solution
This Java-based project demonstrates the implementation of a cab booking solution using Apache Kafka for real-time driver location updates.

Overview
The main objective of this project is to showcase the utilization of Apache Kafka in a practical scenario. In this solution, I have developed a cab booking system where the real-time location of the driver is updated through Apache Kafka, providing a seamless and efficient experience for both users and drivers.
